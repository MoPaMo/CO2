PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO "STAR" THIS REPOSITORY :)

If you rather keep your project secret, feel free
to email the author at `<ueda@latelierdueda.com>`; any
private correspondence is treated as confidential.

If your problem is `getting a NULL return`, the possible cause is `hardware problems` like cabling, signal level, broken HW, and so on. I'm afraid that I have no idea to solve it.
